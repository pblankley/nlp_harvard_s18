Class focus:
text generation
- natural controllable accurate and efficient 

w is 1xd and b is real 1x1
phi maps from x to R->d

vocab is usually 10,000

model 1: bow
model 2: bog of bigrams
model 3: word embeddings
model 4: word embedding + 
    we learn the embeddings as well (makes the optimization non convex)
